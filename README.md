* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions; THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests<br>
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options; THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under<br>
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username; THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile<br>
