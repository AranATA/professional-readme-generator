## **professional README generator**<br>
<br>
<br>

## description

***
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application will be invoked by using the following command: `node index.js`. After receiving the answers the application creates a README.md file in the generatedREADME folder. Each subsequent generation will overwrite the existing README file.  

<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input:<br>
* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository; THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions<br>
* WHEN I enter my project title; THEN this is displayed as the title of the README<br>
* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions; THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests<br>
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options; THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under<br>
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username; THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile<br>
* WHEN I enter my email address; THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions<br>
* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents; THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README<br>
<br>
<br>

## usage

***

Under the link below you will find a walkthrough video that demonstrates; how a user would invoke the application from the command line, how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application and a generated README.md that matches the user input and has a functioning table of contents.<br>
If the video appears out of focus please hit the space bar twice.
